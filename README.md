# Space Shooter Prototype

**PG29 Rapid Prototyping**

Date: 2026-02-08

## About the Project

This project is to create two different prototypes based around the empathy map and notes taken during class. There are 3 builds of each of the prototype, 2 that I made and the one made during class.


### What I did:

After getting feedback from 2 players and using the empathy to try and understand their wants, I started from scratch and came up with two prototypes.

I created the first prototype with user experience and feedback as the focus. Players struggled to understand what the abilities were and found the lack of different screens to be tedious.
This prototype included:
- Basic VFX
- New sprites
- Main Menu screen
- Death screen

I continued working on the first prototype to create the second prototype. This time I focused more on the game features themselves. The original prototype got quickly boring and had no challenge to keep the player from wanting to continue to play.
This prototype included:
- 2 new powerups/pickups
- Multi hit meteors
- Added a highscore
- Increased speed/spawnrate through time.

More detailed notes including the empathy map is inside `dev log.pfd`
